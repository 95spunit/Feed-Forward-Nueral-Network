# Feed forward Nueral Network for Churn Prediction

This repository contains the **Integrative Project** by Punit Giri, focusing on leveraging data analytics and advanced methodologies to define problems, develop solutions, and present findings effectively. The project is designed in three distinct stages:

1. **Problem Definition and Audience Identification**
2. **Solution Development**
3. **Project Presentation**

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to create a comprehensive data-driven solution using techniques like **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** or **Computer Vision (CV)**. The project is designed to address real-world challenges, emphasizing clear problem definition and impactful solution delivery.

## Features
- **Data Exploration**: In-depth exploration and preprocessing of data.
- **Solution Design**: Development of predictive or analytical models tailored to the defined problem.
- **Presentation**: Visual storytelling and result interpretation for target audiences.
